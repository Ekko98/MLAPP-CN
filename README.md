# This project does not support direct reading by online browser
In principle, files in any format other than Markdown text will no longer be available. After verification, the pdf may be updated occasionally, but don't expect it.
I still have to clone myself to find a solution to the reading problem. I don’t want to explore it.
Using the [mdmath](https://github.com/goessner/mdmath) plugin in VS Code, you can preview the latex in Markdown in real time, or go to [this link] (https://marketplace.visualstudio. Com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath) install directly.

This series is a new pit, and I hope everyone will criticize me!
